# Venus Protocol Automatic Reward Allocation

## To be released

### Overview

Venus Protocol aims to provide users with a fair and transparent system to earn rewards from their participation in lending and borrowing activities. Through this income distribution system, funds are allocated to various recipients, promoting the stability, growth, and incentivization of the protocol and benefiting the Venus Protocol community as a whole.

### Income Generation

The Venus Protocol generates income through the following mechanisms:

- **Spread between Borrow and Supply Rates**: Income is generated from the interest rate spread between borrowers and lenders. Borrowers pay interest on their borrowed assets, while lenders earn interest on the tokens they supply to the protocol.

- **Liquidations**: Income is also generated through liquidations, which occur when borrowers fail to maintain their collateral ratios. In such cases, their collateral is seized and sold to repay their debts, generating income for the protocol.

### Income Distribution

The income generated by the Venus Protocol is distributed to various destinations to fulfill different purposes. The distribution includes the following allocations:
The income generated from spreads is accrued in the Protocol Share Reserve based on block thresholds. On the other hand, income from liquidations is deducted from each liquidation transaction and transferred to the Protocol Share Reserve.
The income distribution takes place within the Protocol Share Reserve contract and is distributed to the following destinations:

1. **Risk Fund**: A portion of the income is allocated to the Risk Fund, which acts as a protective measure to safeguard the protocol in case of unforeseen shortfalls or losses. It ensures the stability and security of the Venus Protocol.

2. **Treasury Reserve**: Another portion of the income is allocated to the Treasury Reserve, responsible for funding the development, maintenance, and ongoing operations of the Venus Protocol. It ensures the availability of resources for continuously enhancing the protocol's features and security.

3. **XVS Vault Rewards**: A portion of the income is allocated to the XVS Vault Rewards, which incentivize users to stake XVS, the native token of the Venus Protocol. By staking their XVS tokens, users can earn additional rewards based on their contribution to the protocol.

4. **Venus Prime Token Program**: The Venus Prime Token Program receives a share of the income to reward users actively participating in the Venus Prime program. This program aims to encourage user engagement and provides additional benefits and incentives to eligible participants.

### Income Transformation

- Initially, the income is held in the Protocol Share Reserve and then distributed to various destinations, including the Risk Fund, the Treasury
- Reserve, the XVS Vault Rewards, and the Venus Prime Token Program.
- The XVSVaultSwapper and RiskFundSwapper are responsible for converting the received income into specific tokens (XVS in the XVSVaultSwapper and USDT in the RiskFundSwapper).
- The income is distributed in a near-streaming manner, meaning it is distributed as it is generated.
- The income is distributed in the underlying tokens, rather than in vTokens.
