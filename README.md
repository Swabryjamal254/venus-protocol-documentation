# Venus Protocol Documentation
The Venus Protocol is a decentralized money market where users can participate in lending activities such as lending, borrowing and liquidating, as well as protocol governance. Users participating in lending markets can supply tokens to earn interest and supply liquidity to the protocol or collateralize borrows. They can also liquidate undercollateralized borrows through the liquidation process. Venus also includes a stable coin, VAI, that users can mint after supplying collateral.

New features in V4 include isolated lending pools, improved governance and risk management, stable rate borrowing, and measures to make VAI sustainable.
